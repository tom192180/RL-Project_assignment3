# RL-Project_assignment3

The project is done by Yibin Feng and I-Fan Lin.

We implemented DQN and improvements like DDQN, Dueling DQN and self play, 
and carry out experiments on following environments:

-slimevolley
https://github.com/hardmaru/slimevolleygym


-cartpole
https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0/

The reference of the codes are mentioned in each file
